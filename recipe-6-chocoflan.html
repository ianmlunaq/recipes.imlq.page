    <p style="text-align: center;"> Chocoflan is a unique dessert that combines two beloved treats: chocolate cake and
        flan. It's essentially a cake
        baked with a layer of creamy custard above, creating a delightful contrast in textures and flavors. Chocoflan
        defies
        the culinary logic by inverting its layers during the baking process. The pan goes into the oven layered with
        caramel, then chocolate cake, then flan. Then later comes out of the oven with the flan and chocolate layers
        reversed.
        It goes into the oven one way and comes out another. The result is a stunning dessert with a rich chocolate
        flavor
        balanced by the smooth sweetness of the custard. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center" class="complementary">Procedure:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>PREHEAT your oven to 375 ¬∫F</li>
        <li>Make caramel by heating the sugar on medium heat until it completely melts & caramelizes; immediately pour
            in
            bottom of a well greased mold & set aside
        </li>
        <li>Prepare cake mix as instructed on box</li>
        <li>Make flan mix by mixing condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, & cream cheese in blender (or by
            hand)
            until smooth
        </li>
        <li>Pour cake mix over the caramel in the mold & then use a spatula or spoon to pour in flan mix so as to not
            create
            an indentation in the cake batter
        </li>
        <li>Tightly cover the mold with aluminum foil, greasing the side that faces the chocoflan</li>
        <li>Place mold in a large roasting pan, tranfer both carefully to your preheated oven, & pour hot water into the
            roasting pan until it reaches about halfway up your mold
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 60 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly
            clean
        </li>
        <li>Remove mold carefully from oven, remove foil cover, let cool to room temperature (~1 hour), & replace foil &
            refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight
        </li>
        <li>To loosen chocoflan from mold, place mold in a large bowl of hot water. To remove, place a plate upside down
            on
            the mold, then flip.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon any remaining caramel from mold over top of chocoflan & enjoy!</li>
