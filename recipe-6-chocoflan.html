    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li><span id="cake">1</span> box of your favorite store-bought chocolate cake</li>
        <li><span id="sugar">1</span> cup white, granulated sugar</li>
        <li><span id="conMilk">14</span> oz condensed milk</li>
        <li><span id="evaMilk">12</span> fl oz evaporated milk</li>
        <li><span id="eggs">6</span> medium eggs</li>
        <li><span id="vanilla">1</span> Tbs vanilla</li>
        <li><span id="cheese">4</span> oz of room temperature cream cheese</li>
    </ul>
    Procedure:
    <ol>
        <li>PREHEAT your oven to 375 ÂºF</li>
        <li>Make caramel by heating the sugar on medium heat until it completely melts & caramelizes; immediately pour in bottom of a well greased mold & set aside</li>
        <li>Prepare cake mix as instructed on box</li>
        <li>Make flan mix by mixing condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, & cream cheese in blender (or by hand) until smooth</li>
        <li>Pour cake mix over the caramel in the mold & then use a spatula or spoon to pour in flan mix so as to not create an indentation in the cake batter</li>
        <li>Tightly cover the mold with aluminum foil, greasing the side that faces the chocoflan</li>
        <li>Place mold in a large roasting pan, tranfer both carefully to your preheated oven, & pour hot water into the roasting pan until it reaches about halfway up your mold</li>
        <li>Bake for 60 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean</li>
        <li>Remove mold carefully from oven, remove foil cover, let cool to room temperature (~1 hour), & replace foil & refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight</li>
        <li>To loosen chocoflan from mold, place mold in a large bowl of hot water. To remove, place a plate upside down on the mold, then flip.</li>
        <li>Spoon any remaining caramel from mold over top of chocoflan & enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
