    </header>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> Curry udon is a Japanese dish that combines the comfort of two favorites: udon noodles and Japanese curry. It features thick, chewy udon noodles served in a rich, flavorful curry broth. The curry itself can be made from scratch with a dashi base or use pre-made roux blocks for a quicker version.

        This hearty noodle soup is known for its satisfying and warming taste, perfect for a quick weeknight meal or a cozy lunch. You might also find variations with additional toppings like sliced pork, tempura vegetables, or even a soft-boiled egg. </p>
